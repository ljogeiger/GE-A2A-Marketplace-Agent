Understand the Flow:

- Google's system will call your DCR endpoint (/dcr in your example).
- The request contains a software_statement, which is a JSON Web Token (JWT) signed by Google. This JWT contains details about the client to be registered, such as required redirect_uris.
- Your DCR endpoint must:
  - Validate the received JWT (as shown in your validate_jwt function).
  - Extract the necessary information from the JWT claims (e.g., auth_app_redirect_uris, google.order).
  - Interact with Okta's APIs to create a new OAuth 2.0 Application instance.
  - Retrieve the client_id and client_secret generated by Okta.
  - Respond to Google with the client_id, client_secret, and client_secret_expires_at: 0.

Decisions:

- json for order + client id instead of db for simplicity
- for now use localhost PROVIDER_URL and then use Cloud Run deployment endpoint
-
